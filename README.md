README for My Game
==================
This is my game! There's hexagons, and this readme!

Trying to learn a more C-style way of doing things, instead of implementing a hacky OOP system with lots of structs and function pointers. Inspired by the code of [Martin's Dungeon Bash](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~mpread/dungeonbash/)
